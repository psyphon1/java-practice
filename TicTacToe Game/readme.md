##  Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java: Project Breakdown

This code implements a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game entirely in Java. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities and key components:

**Classes:**

* **Main:**  The entry point of the program. It creates instances of `XO` and `Logic` classes and calls the `menu` method of `XO` to start the game.
* **Logic:** Handles the core game logic. It manages player turns, validates moves, checks for win conditions, and interacts with the `XO` class to update the game board.
* **XO:** Handles the game board and user interaction. It initializes the board with empty positions, displays the board to the user, and takes user input for their moves.

**Key functionalities:**

* **Menu System:** The program starts with a menu offering options to start a new game or exit.
* **Player Setup:** Players enter their names before starting the game.
* **Game Board:** The game uses a 3x3 character array to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Empty positions are marked with numbers (1-9) that players use to select their moves.
* **Turn Management:** The game alternates between players, prompting each player to enter their move.
* **Move Validation:** The code checks if the selected position is empty before placing the player's mark (X or O).
* **Win Detection:** The code checks for winning conditions after each move, including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.
* **Game Over:** The game ends when a player wins or all positions are filled.

**Additional features:**

* Scanner class is used for user input throughout the game.
* The code includes comments to explain specific functionalities within the classes.

**Learning points for programmers:**

* This project is a good example for practicing fundamental Java concepts like variables, arrays, conditional statements, loops, and user input.
* It demonstrates basic game development logic in Java, including handling turns, game state management, and win conditions.
* The code can be further enhanced by adding features like AI opponent, difficulty levels, or graphical user interface (GUI) using Java libraries.

This Tic-Tac-Toe project serves as a springboard for those new to Java programming, allowing them to solidify their understanding of core concepts through a practical application.
